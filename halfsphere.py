# This is a sample GLUT program that constructs a hemisphere made 
# up of triangular facets.  It relies heavily on the geometry and
# quaternion packadges.  We'll discuss the design of geometry.py 
# first when we examine affine spaces this and next week.  We'll
# look at using quaternions for specifying rotations, the ideas
# that inform quat.py, in later weeks.
#
# The OpenGL drawing part of the code occurs in drawScene.  The
# building of the geometric model occurs in gen_facet(), and also
# in the main and myKeyFunc procedures.
#
# This code was adapted from Sam Buss' SimpleDraw.py.
